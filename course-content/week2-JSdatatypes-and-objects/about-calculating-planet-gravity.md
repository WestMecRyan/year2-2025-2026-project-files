To calculate the gravitational acceleration (gravity) on a planet, we can use the following formula derived from Newton’s law of universal gravitation:

$$
g = \frac{GM}{R^2}
$$

Where:

* $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity,
* $G$ is the gravitational constant,
* $M$ is the mass of the planet,
* $R$ is the radius of the planet.

### Why does Mercury have 37% of Earth's gravity even though its mass is 1/20th of Earth's?

Mercury has less mass than Earth (about 1/20th), but its gravity is still about 37% of Earth's. This can be explained by looking at both mass and radius in the formula.

While Mercury has much less mass, it also has a much smaller radius compared to Earth. The formula $g = \frac{GM}{R^2}$ tells us that gravity depends on both mass and the square of the radius.

### A deeper look:

* **Mercury’s Mass**: It's about 1/20th the mass of Earth.
* **Mercury’s Radius**: Mercury's radius is about 0.38 times that of Earth's radius.

Since the gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the radius, a smaller radius means that the gravitational acceleration on Mercury is higher than what you might expect if you were just comparing mass. Specifically:

$$
g_{\text{Mercury}} = \frac{M_{\text{Mercury}}}{R_{\text{Mercury}}^2}
$$

* If Mercury’s mass is 1/20th that of Earth, and its radius is 0.38 times Earth's radius, we can approximate the gravitational acceleration as:

$$
g_{\text{Mercury}} = \frac{1/20}{(0.38)^2} \approx 0.37 \times g_{\text{Earth}}
$$

So, despite having only 1/20th of Earth’s mass, the smaller radius of Mercury gives it a relatively stronger gravitational pull at the surface, making it about 37% of Earth's gravity.

### In summary:

* **Mass** decreases gravity.
* **Radius** increases gravity, especially when squared.

Mercury has a smaller radius compared to Earth, which increases the effect of its mass on gravity more than it would if it had a similar radius to Earth.

When you plug the values into the formula $g = \frac{GM}{R^2}$ for Mercury, the numbers would be quite large, especially if you're using the full scientific values for mass, radius, and the gravitational constant.

Here’s a quick breakdown of the values you'd need to use:

1. **Gravitational constant ($G$)**:
   $G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{kg}^{-2}$

2. **Mass of Mercury ($M_{\text{Mercury}}$)**:
   $M_{\text{Mercury}} = 3.3011 \times 10^{23} \, \text{kg}$

3. **Radius of Mercury ($R_{\text{Mercury}}$)**:
   $R_{\text{Mercury}} = 2.4397 \times 10^{6} \, \text{m}$

If you input all these values into the formula for Mercury’s gravity:

$$
g_{\text{Mercury}} = \frac{(6.67430 \times 10^{-11}) \times (3.3011 \times 10^{23})}{(2.4397 \times 10^{6})^2}
$$

This would result in a large number, but not as unwieldy as you might think since the radius is squared, and the exponents will cancel out some of the large powers. The calculation simplifies to:

$$
g_{\text{Mercury}} = 3.7 \, \text{m/s}^2
$$

Which is approximately 37% of Earth's gravity.

### Why the numbers aren’t too unwieldy:

* Even though each value has exponents, you're mainly working with powers of 10, which tend to cancel out or scale down the result.
* Also, most scientific calculators or software (like Python or Excel) handle these large numbers quite easily by automatically adjusting for powers of 10.
