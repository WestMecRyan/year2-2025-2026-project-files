In an SPA, **the server still needs to deliver the client code to the browser**. Here's how it works:

## The SPA Flow:

### 1. Initial Request - Server sends client code
```
Browser: "GET / HTTP/1.1"
Server: "Here's index.html + your JavaScript app"
```

### 2. Client takes over
Once the JavaScript loads, it handles everything client-side (routing, rendering, etc.)

## Typical SPA Setup:

```
my-project/
├── client/                    ← Source code (you write this)
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── App.js
│   │   ├── HomePage.js
│   │   └── AboutPage.js
│   ├── package.json
│   └── webpack.config.js
├── dist/                      ← Built/compiled code (auto-generated)
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── bundle.js              ← All your JS combined
│   └── styles.css
└── server/
    └── server.js              ← Serves files from dist/
```

## Your server.js would look like:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();

// Serve static files from dist folder
app.use(express.static('dist'));

// For SPA - send index.html for all routes
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../dist/index.html'));
});

app.listen(3000);
```

## The build process:
```bash
# In client folder
npm run build    # Creates optimized files in dist/
```

This typically:
- Combines all your `.js` files into one `bundle.js`
- Minifies CSS
- Optimizes images
- Creates a final `index.html` that loads everything

## What the browser gets:
```html
<!-- dist/index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div id="app"></div>  <!-- React/Vue/etc mounts here -->
  <script src="bundle.js"></script>  <!-- Your entire app -->
</body>
</html>
```

## So to answer your question:
**The server delivers the client code**, but in a SPA:
- Server's job is much simpler (just serve static files + API)
- Client code does all the page rendering and routing
- You build/compile your source code into optimized files that the server serves

The "client" folder is where **you develop**, but the server serves the **built version** to browsers!
